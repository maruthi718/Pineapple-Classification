# Pineapple Classification Project

This project aims to classify pineapple images into raw or ripe. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict whether a pineapple image is raw or ripe.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of a collection of labeled pineapple images. The dataset is divided into two classes: raw and ripe.

## Model

We have developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) for pineapple classification. The model is trained on the provided dataset to learn the features that distinguish between raw and ripe pineapples.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/pineapple-classification.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Use the following command to run the pineapple classification script:

```bash
python classify_pineapple.py path/to/your/image.jpg
